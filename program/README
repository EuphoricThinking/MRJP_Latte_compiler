The program is compiled by the command `make` executed in the root. Run the program by typing in the terminal:

`cat path_to_file | ./ltc`

or (followed by ENTER and the sequence of statements, ended with CTRL+D):

`./ltc`

The code incorporates fragments of the code from JPP interpreter project, who I am an author.
