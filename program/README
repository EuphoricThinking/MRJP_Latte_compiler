The program is compiled by the command `make` executed in the root and creates `latc_x86_64` executable file. In order to compile a given file to assembly, run in terminal:
`./latc_x86_64 path_to_file`

The result of compilation is saved in `path_to_file.s`. Additionally, the program links the assembly file with `runtime.o` library; the resulting executable file is saved as `path_to_file`.

The code incorporates fragments of the code from JPP interpreter project, who I am an author.

lib folder contains `runtime.o`, which is linked with the `.s` file generated by the program.

UPDATE:
Passes avilable tests for arrays, structs and classes. At this moment without inheritance, but I have implemented vtables, therefore now I am working on inheritance tree and I want to believe that I would manage to deliver it.
